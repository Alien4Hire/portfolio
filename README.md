# Jason Maynard — Portfolio Website

This is my full-stack portfolio application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), React, and Node.js. It showcases my software engineering skills through interactive UI, server-side logic, real-world data integrations, and modern web architecture. Designed to be clean, performant, and highly responsive.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Next.js App Router with Server Components**  
  Fast-loading pages with server-rendered content and streaming support.

- 🎯 **Dynamic Project Routing**  
  Each project has its own URL (`/projects/[slug]`) and fetches dynamic data from a backend or CMS.

- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion Animations**  
  Smooth transitions and professional UI polish.

- 🧪 **TypeScript + Zod Validation**  
  End-to-end type safety on forms, APIs, and user inputs.

  Admin panel protected with secure sign-in.

  Custom greeting or behavior based on user location.

- 📈 **GitHub + Blog Integration via API**  
  Auto-displays latest commits, posts, or project activity.

## 🧪 Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
